🧠 Quant Risk Engine — Functional Overview

Your project is now a multi-layer risk + investment analysis system.
Each component answers a specific financial question.

1️⃣ 📈 Data Loading & Returns Engine
📌 What it does

Fetches historical price data

Computes daily log returns

📊 Outputs

Adjusted price series

Log return series

🎯 Why it exists

Returns are the foundation of all risk and performance metrics.

2️⃣ 🚀 Growth Metrics Engine
📌 What it computes

Total Return

CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate)

📊 Outputs

Final growth statistics

Growth curve plots

🎯 What it answers

“How much did the asset grow over this period?”

3️⃣ ⚠️ Risk Metrics Engine
📌 What it computes

Annualized volatility

Downside volatility

Max drawdown (%)

📊 Outputs

Risk summary

Rolling volatility plots

🎯 What it answers

“How risky was the journey?”

4️⃣ ⚖️ Risk-Adjusted Metrics Engine
📌 What it computes

Sharpe Ratio

Sortino Ratio

Calmar Ratio

📊 Outputs

Summary risk-adjusted scores

Rolling Sharpe plot

Comparison visuals

🎯 What it answers

“Was the return worth the risk?”

5️⃣ 🌪 Tail Risk Metrics Engine
📌 What it computes

Skewness

Kurtosis

Value at Risk (VaR)

Conditional VaR (CVaR)

📊 Outputs

Return distribution plots

Tail risk summaries

🎯 What it answers

“How bad do extreme events get?”

6️⃣ 📉 Market Sensitivity Engine
📌 What it computes

Beta

Alpha

R²

📊 Outputs

Regression metrics

Stock vs market scatter plot

🎯 What it answers

“How dependent is the stock on the market?”

7️⃣ 🧘 Stability Metrics Engine
📌 What it computes

Rolling Sharpe Ratio

Maximum underwater duration

Recovery time from worst drawdown

📊 Outputs

Stability plots

Time-based risk summaries

🎯 What it answers

“How reliable and resilient was performance over time?”

8️⃣ 📚 Drawdown Events Engine (Event-Based Risk)
📌 What it extracts

For each drawdown episode:

Peak date

Trough date

Recovery date (if recovered)

Drawdown depth (%)

Decline duration (peak → trough)

Recovery time (trough → peak)

Total underwater time (peak → peak)

📊 Outputs

Ranked tables (worst & recent)

Drawdown & recovery bar charts

🎯 What it answers

“How do individual crashes and recoveries actually behave?”

9️⃣ 💰 Investment Simulation Engine
📌 What it simulates

Given an initial investment amount:

Portfolio value over time

Worst value reached (₹ / $)

Best value reached (₹ / $)

Largest single-day gain (₹ / $)

Largest single-day loss (₹ / $)

All with exact dates.

📊 Outputs

Capital evolution plots

Daily P&L plots

Drawdown in currency plots

🎯 What it answers

“What would my money have actually experienced?”

🗣️ One-Paragraph Project Description (Use This)

“This project is a modular quant risk and investment analysis engine that evaluates asset performance across growth, risk, tail behavior, market sensitivity, stability, and real-world capital experience. It combines return-based analytics with event-level drawdown analysis and investment simulations to translate abstract financial metrics into intuitive, decision-relevant insights.”

That description is mentor- and interviewer-ready.

✅ Final Takeaway

You didn’t just build metrics.
You built a complete analytical narrative:

What happened → why it happened → how bad it got → how long it lasted → how much money it affected.
